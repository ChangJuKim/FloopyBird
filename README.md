# FloopyBird
My first Unity project and my first step in developing my own game! 

5/14/2024
Floopy bird is finished with version 2.0.0! I am now editing the UI to be more palatable.

**As of now, this game only runs on Windows. I will add support for Mac and Linux in the future.**

3. Download zip folder and extract zip folder to a location of your choice
5. Run Floopy Bird.exe

## Controls

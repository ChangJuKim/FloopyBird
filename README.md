# FloopyBird
My first Unity project! 

Full credit to Mark Brown and his amazing youtube channel Game Maker's ToolKit: https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK. I am following their youtube tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM.

I am now making additional changes to the game so I can better learn Unity.


# Instructions
1. Download the project into a folder.
2. Run the Floopy Bird.exe file.

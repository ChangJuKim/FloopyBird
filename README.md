# FloopyBird
My first Unity project and my first step in developing my own game! 

Full credit to Mark Brown and his amazing youtube channel Game Maker's ToolKit: https://www.youtube.com/@GMTK. I am following their youtube tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM.

I am now making additional changes to the game so I can better learn Unity.

This game runs on Windows. I am unsure if it runs on Mac or Linux.

## Installation

3. Download zip folder and extract zip folder to a location of your choice

Currently there is no way to close the game -- press windows key to see the taskbar at the bottom and right click the black and white box to close the window.
